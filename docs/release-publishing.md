# Release Publishing

This repo publishes CurseForge files from GitHub Releases.

## One-time setup

1. Open the CurseForge API token page:

```text
https://www.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens
```

2. Log in if CurseForge asks you to.
3. Create or copy a CurseForge API token.
4. Open this GitHub repository.
5. Go to Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions.
6. Click New repository secret.
7. Use this name:

```text
CURSEFORGE_TOKEN
```

8. Paste the CurseForge token as the value.
9. Save it.

Do not put the token in a commit, release body, Discord message, or issue.

## Publishing a new version

1. Update `mod_version` in `gradle.properties`.

For example, if the previous CurseForge file was `ghosts-26.1.2-0.1.0-fabric.jar`, use:

```properties
mod_version=26.1.2-0.1.1-fabric
```

2. Commit and push the change.
3. Open GitHub -> Releases -> Draft a new release.
4. Create a new tag, for example:

```text
v26.1.2-0.1.1-fabric
```

5. Set the release title, for example:

```text
Ghosts 26.1.2 - 0.1.1 Fabric (Unofficial Port)
```

6. Write the changelog in the release body.
7. Click Publish release.

GitHub Actions will build the mod, attach the jar to the GitHub Release, and upload the same jar to CurseForge. The GitHub Release body becomes the CurseForge changelog.

## If it fails

1. Open GitHub -> Actions.
2. Click Publish CurseForge Release.
3. Open the failed run.
4. Read the red step.
5. Fix the problem and use Re-run jobs.

Most failures are caused by a missing `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN`, an expired token, or a release version that already exists on CurseForge.
